# Let's go bug hunting...  :beetle:
> In order to receive assignment points for your program, you'll need to debug and fix any issues. Follow the steps below to help find the errors. Once you find and fix all the program errors, this **Test Failure** issue will close automatically.

1. First, you'll need to find the **GitHub Action Bot's** annotations on the code you just submitted. Look in the [Files Changed](https://github.com/{{ env.REPO }}/pull/1/files) tab of the Feedback pull request. Fix all errors outlined, then resubmit your program.
    - Don't see the annotations there? Open the [Feedback](https://github.com/{{ env.REPO }}/pull/1) pull request, then click the name of your most recent failed commit (it'll have a red X).
    - This step may need to be repeated after you resubmit your updated program. 
2. Second, if the test log appears below, review it for any clues. It will only appear after you fix all syntax and style errors detected by the bot in step 1.
3. Re-read the [directions and problem statement](https://github.com/{{ env.REPO }}/blob/main/README.md) very closely. Did you miss any small details?
4. Open the assignment in [Canvas](https://uvu.instructure.com/) and find the **rubric**. Execute your program with the inputs listed in the rubric's test cases. Does your output match what's expected? 
    - Look closely at the formatting, punctuation, white space, and capitalization... it must match exactly.
5. Re-write your algorithm from scratch before updating your program.
