## Objectives
- Practice the programming skills you've learned in this lesson,

- Learn how to properly submit your programming assignments via GitHub, and

- Experience how a rubric will be used to grade your programming assignments.

## Directions
1. Design a program that:
    - Has a comment that indicates this is Lesson 7 Programming Assignment
    - Displays your full name to the console/shell
    - Calculates and displays the number of items in eight dozen
    - Calculates and displays the number of weeks in 180 days, as a whole number (truncated)
<br><br>    
2. Test your program by running it and examining the output. Fix any errors that occur. Your output in the shell/console should match the example below:

```
Jane Doe
96
25
```


## Submission
- Complete and submit your program as outlined in this [instructional video](https://youtu.be/SrJ_c8S1_D8)

## Replit "Bug" 
Sometimes Repl.it will ignores the ```.replit``` configuration file. This will render your run button useless. If this happens, manually run your file by typing ```python3 src/exercise.py``` at the prompt in the console:
